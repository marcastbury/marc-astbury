            <h2>Turkish Football</h2>
            <p>I had the pleasure of attending a Turkish football match last weekend.</p>
            <p>20 degrees and blue skies greeted me as I left my apartment in Kadik√∂y and wandered down to the ferry
                port. The ride across the Bosphorus took around 20 minutes, which felt far less as I gazed out upon the
                magical cityscape.</p>
            <p>Upon docking I met with Anil. We headed to grab food before descending upon a park filled with Besiktas
                ultras. Flares, drums, and alcohol followed. I thought English fans were a little too enthusiastic in
                their aproach to supporting their team, they have nothing on the Turks.</p>
            <p>4 hours later (and a few cups of Gordon's gin), we headed down the hill toward the stadium. The Vodafone
                Arena is colossol stadium seating just under 43,000 fans. Located on the banks of the river and just
                across from the Royal Palace it is a thing of beauty.</p>
            <p>Pre-game I purchased a jersey (it cost $15, crazy compared to $120+ in England).</p>
            <p>The noise was deafening inside the arena and so was the relentless supply of cigarrette fumes - smoking
                is very much allowed in Turkish stadiums. Ex-Chelsea man Batsuayi scored after 50 seconds which
                delighted the home supporters and Besiktas cruised to a 4-1 victory against a lackluster Alayanspor.</p>
