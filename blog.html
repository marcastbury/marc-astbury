            <h3>Turkish Football</h3>
            <p>I had the pleasure of attending a Turkish football match last weekend.</p>
            <p>20 degrees and blue skies greeted me as I left my apartment in Kadiköy and wandered down to the ferry
                port. The ride across the Bosphorus took around 20 minutes, which felt far less as I gazed out upon the
                magical cityscape.</p>
            <p>Upon docking I met with Anil. We headed to grab food before descending upon a park filled with Besiktas
                ultras. Flares, drums, and alcohol followed. I thought English fans were a little too enthusiastic in
                their aproach to supporting their team, they have nothing on the Turks.</p>
            <p>4 hours later (and a few cups of Gordon's gin), we headed down the hill toward the stadium. The Vodafone
                Arena is colossol stadium seating just under 43,000 fans. Located on the banks of the river and just
                across from the Royal Palace it is a thing of beauty.</p>
            <p>Pre-game I purchased a jersey (it cost $15, crazy compared to $120+ in England).</p>
            <p>The noise was deafening inside the arena and so was the relentless supply of cigarrette fumes - smoking
                is very much allowed in Turkish stadiums. Ex-Chelsea man Batsuayi scored after 50 seconds which
                delighted the home supporters and Besiktas cruised to a 4-1 victory against a lackluster Alayanspor.</p>

            <h3>Living Nomadically</h3>
            <p>&quot;I can&apos;t wait to travel again&quot;.</p>
            <p>Between late-2019 to mid-2022, the pandemic has removed any possibility of global movement for most
                people (especially those based in Singapore, China etc).</p>
            <p>The aforementioned quote has been uttered in countless conversations with friends, customers, even
                the&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This, however, has not been my experience of the past few years.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I did a back of the napkin tally on the number of flights Anna and I have taken in that period and ended
                up with a total of 18, not included layovers and multi-leg trips.</p>
            <p>Upon hearing that, one may think we are reckless travel addicts. This couldn&apos;t be further from the
                truth.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Bootstrapping RandomDots has meant living in lower cost countries has been essential to avoid an overload
                of stress on finances. That being said, visa restrictions and border closures has meant countless
                country switches and re-settling.</p>
            <p>With Anna&apos;s native country of China being completely closed, and my country of the UK being
                notoriously tricky to get a visa for any longer than a few months, we&apos;ve been hopping to anywhere
                that will take us.</p>
            <p>Being nomadic has provided a wealth of cultural experiences and interactions that have been incredibly
                fulfilling, however, being on the move is tiring.</p>
            <p>Hopefully 2022 and beyond contain a <em>little</em> less country hopping &#129310</p>
