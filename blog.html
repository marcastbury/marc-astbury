        <p>Welcome to my blog, below are articles written between 2012-2022.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item-body">
                <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                    <p>I had the pleasure of attending a Turkish football match last weekend.</p>
                    <p>20 degrees and blue skies greeted me as I left my apartment in Kadik√∂y and wandered down to the
                        ferry
                        port. The ride across the Bosphorus took around 20 minutes, which felt far less as I gazed out
                        upon the
                        magical cityscape.</p>
                    <p>Upon docking I met with Anil. We headed to grab food before descending upon a park filled with
                        Besiktas
                        ultras. Flares, drums, and alcohol followed. I thought English fans were a little too
                        enthusiastic in
                        their aproach to supporting their team, they have nothing on the Turks.</p>
                    <p>4 hours later (and a few cups of Gordon's gin), we headed down the hill toward the stadium. The
                        Vodafone
                        Arena is colossol stadium seating just under 43,000 fans. Located on the banks of the river and
                        just
                        across from the Royal Palace it is a thing of beauty.</p>
                    <p>Pre-game I purchased a jersey (it cost $15, crazy compared to $120+ in England).</p>
                    <p>The noise was deafening inside the arena and so was the relentless supply of cigarrette fumes -
                        smoking
                        is very much allowed in Turkish stadiums. Ex-Chelsea man Batsuayi scored after 50 seconds which
                        delighted the home supporters and Besiktas cruised to a 4-1 victory against a lackluster
                        Alayanspor.</p>

                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t wait to travel again&quot;.</p>
                    <p>Between late-2019 to mid-2022, the pandemic has removed any possibility of global movement for
                        most
                        people (especially those based in Singapore, China etc).</p>
                    <p>The aforementioned quote has been uttered in countless conversations with friends, customers,
                        even
                        the&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This, however, has not been my experience of the past few years.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I did a back of the napkin tally on the number of flights Anna and I have taken in that period
                        and ended
                        up with a total of 18, not included layovers and multi-leg trips.</p>
                    <p>Upon hearing that, one may think we are reckless travel addicts. This couldn&apos;t be further
                        from the
                        truth.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Bootstrapping RandomDots has meant living in lower cost countries has been essential to avoid an
                        overload
                        of stress on finances. That being said, visa restrictions and border closures has meant
                        countless
                        country switches and re-settling.</p>
                    <p>With Anna&apos;s native country of China being completely closed, and my country of the UK being
                        notoriously tricky to get a visa for any longer than a few months, we&apos;ve been hopping to
                        anywhere
                        that will take us.</p>
                    <p>Being nomadic has provided a wealth of cultural experiences and interactions that have been
                        incredibly
                        fulfilling, however, being on the move is tiring.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully 2022 and beyond contain a <em>little</em> less country hopping &#129310</p>
