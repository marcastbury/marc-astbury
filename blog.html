            </div>

                <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                    <p>I had the pleasure of attending a Turkish football match last weekend.</p>
                    <p>20 degrees and blue skies greeted me as I left my apartment in Kadik√∂y and wandered down to the
                        ferry
                        port. The ride across the Bosphorus took around 20 minutes, which felt far less as I gazed out
                        upon the
                        magical cityscape.</p>
                    <p>Upon docking I met with Anil. We headed to grab food before descending upon a park filled with
                        Besiktas
                        ultras. Flares, drums, and alcohol followed. I thought English fans were a little too
                        enthusiastic in
                        their aproach to supporting their team, they have nothing on the Turks.</p>
                    <p>4 hours later (and a few cups of Gordon's gin), we headed down the hill toward the stadium. The
                        Vodafone
                        Arena is colossol stadium seating just under 43,000 fans. Located on the banks of the river and
                        just
                        across from the Royal Palace it is a thing of beauty.</p>
                    <p>Pre-game I purchased a jersey (it cost $15, crazy compared to $120+ in England).</p>
                    <p>The noise was deafening inside the arena and so was the relentless supply of cigarrette fumes -
                        smoking
                        is very much allowed in Turkish stadiums. Ex-Chelsea man Batsuayi scored after 50 seconds which
                        delighted the home supporters and Besiktas cruised to a 4-1 victory against a lackluster
                        Alayanspor.</p>

                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t wait to travel again&quot;.</p>
                    <p>Between late-2019 to mid-2022, the pandemic has removed any possibility of global movement for
                        most
                        people (especially those based in Singapore, China etc).</p>
                    <p>The aforementioned quote has been uttered in countless conversations with friends, customers,
                        even
                        the&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This, however, has not been my experience of the past few years.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I did a back of the napkin tally on the number of flights Anna and I have taken in that period
                        and ended
                        up with a total of 18, not included layovers and multi-leg trips.</p>
                    <p>Upon hearing that, one may think we are reckless travel addicts. This couldn&apos;t be further
                        from the
                        truth.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Bootstrapping RandomDots has meant living in lower cost countries has been essential to avoid an
                        overload
                        of stress on finances. That being said, visa restrictions and border closures has meant
                        countless
                        country switches and re-settling.</p>
                    <p>With Anna&apos;s native country of China being completely closed, and my country of the UK being
                        notoriously tricky to get a visa for any longer than a few months, we&apos;ve been hopping to
                        anywhere
                        that will take us.</p>
                    <p>Being nomadic has provided a wealth of cultural experiences and interactions that have been
                        incredibly
                        fulfilling, however, being on the move is tiring.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully 2022 and beyond contain a <em>little</em> less country hopping &#129310</p>

                <h3>Robert Pirsig's Wisdom</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-item-body">
                <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                    <p>To the untrained eye, ego-climbing and selfless climbing may appear identical. Both kinds of
                        climbers place one front in front of the other.</p>

                    <p>Both breathe in and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested. But
                        what a difference! The ego climber is like an instrument that&rsquo;s out of adjustment. He puts
                        his foot down an instant too soon or too late. He&rsquo;s likely to miss a beautiful passage of
                        sunlight through the trees. He goes on when the sloppiness of his step shows he&rsquo;s tired.
                        He rests at odd times. He looks up the trail trying to see what&rsquo;s ahead even when he knows
                        what&rsquo;s ahead because he looked up a second before. He goes too fast or too slow for the
                        conditions and when he talks his talk is forever about somewhere else, something else.
                        He&rsquo;s here but he&rsquo;s not here. He rejects the here, is unhappy with it, and wants to
                        be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be just as unhappy because then it will be
                        &lsquo;here.&rsquo; What he&rsquo;s looking for, what he wants, is all around him, but he
                        doesn&rsquo;t want that because it is all around him. Every step&rsquo;s an effort, both
                        physically and spiritually, because he imagines his goal to be external and distant.</p>

                    <p>A duality exists in the ego climber's mind; the subject and the object.</p>

                    <p>The mountain is an object to be overcome, the subject is the overcomer. This separation prevents
                        any real connection from being established between the two. The separation does not allow for
                        the moment-to-moment minutia to be fully appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Pirsig strongly believed that whenever separation exists between subject and object, nothing of
                        true quality can be created.</p>

                    <p>When we understand the inseparable nature of our existence with the rest of the cosmos</p>

                    <p>The subject gains a heightened left of self-worth if he successfully climbs the mountain. An
                        effort to achieve &lsquo;self-glorification&rsquo; as Pirsig puts it.</p>

                    <p>&ldquo;It is the sides of the mountain that sustain life, not the top - here is where things
                        grow.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>The mountain and climb is a metaphor for many endeavors. We live in a culture where many actions
                        are taken for the subsequent social ladder climbing they are deemed to bring.</p>

                    <p>At Universities the term &lsquo;it will look great on your C.V&rsquo; can be heard ringing around
                        the corridors. But what is this arbitrary ranking system we are referencing? The notion of
                        &lsquo;more&rsquo; or &lsquo;next&rsquo; is so commonplace, that we rarely stop to question
                        their application.</p>
